        <p>Andrew G. Stanton - July 3, 2025</p>
<h1>How Skype’s 2025 Shutdown Pushed Me to Start Building Sovereign Software</h1>
<p>In May 2025, Microsoft shut down Skype.</p>
<p>Quietly, and without ceremony, one of the world’s oldest internet communication tools — a platform that powered many early startup teams and remote collaborations — was gone.</p>
<p>For StartNation, it meant an abrupt pivot. We had to move all our team communication to Discord. I wasn’t new to it — I’d first used Discord back in 2019 through the Evergreen Coin community. At the time, it was just a chat app. Free, decently built, and surprisingly good for group discussions.</p>
<p>But that shift — from Skype to Discord — made something click.</p>
<p>Suddenly I could see how deeply embedded we were in tools we didn’t own.<br />
We used Discord for communication, GitHub for code, and depended on centralized platforms and APIs for almost everything else.</p>
<p>We didn’t think much of it… until one of them got shut down.</p>
<p>Skype’s death wasn’t the real problem.<br />
It was a <strong>symptom</strong> — of a deeper issue.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We were renting our entire workflow.<br />
And in doing so, we were <strong>renting our own signal</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h3>🛑 The Wakeup Call</h3>
<p>What happens when your tools disappear mid-project?<br />
What if GitHub flags your repo?<br />
What if Discord bans your server?</p>
<p>Sure, you can rebuild.<br />
But what you’ve lost — your posts, threads, commits, relationships — might never come back.</p>
<p>That’s when I started building <strong>MyContinuum</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3>🛠️ The Path Forward: Sovereign Tools</h3>
<p>MyContinuum isn’t just another app.<br />
It’s a <strong>response</strong>.</p>
<p>A response to being dependent on infrastructure I don’t control.<br />
A response to watching others get deplatformed, demonetized, or quietly erased.<br />
A response to the slow erosion of ownership in a world where everything is on loan from someone else’s server.</p>
<p>Now I publish articles, share thoughts, and track signal —<br />
all from a stack I control, and I am seriously thinking of integrating git into this as well.</p>
<p>Local when I want it.<br />
Zappable when I share it.<br />
<strong>Mine either way.</strong></p>
<hr />
<h3>✊ Closing</h3>
<p>So no — Discord wasn’t the villain.<br />
It was just the final nudge.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m done renting my own data.<br />
I’m done outsourcing my voice, my work, or my relationships.<br />
I’m building sovereignly now — and helping others do the same.</p>
