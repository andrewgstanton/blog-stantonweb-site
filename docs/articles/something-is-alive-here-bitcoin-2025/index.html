        <p><strong>At Bitcoin 2025 and on Nostr, I’ve rediscovered what decentralization really means — not just as a technical design, but as a lived experience of freedom. This article reflects on how alive and tangible that freedom feels: owning your identity, zapping freely, publishing without permission, and building outside institutional control. It’s not about hype — it’s about sovereignty, trust, and conviction. For the first time in a long time, freedom doesn’t feel like a slogan. It feels real. It feels alive.</strong></p>

        <p>Andrew G. Stanton - June 8, 2025</p>
<p>I’ve spent years chasing the promise of freedom.
In startups. In faith communities. In movements that claimed to be for the people.</p>
<p>And yet — so often, that promise felt just out of reach.
Conditional. Corporate. Sanitized.
A freedom with fine print.</p>
<p>But here —
Here in the thick of Bitcoin 2025, on Nostr, among misfits and builders and signal-bringers —
<strong>something is alive.</strong></p>
<p>It’s not a platform.
It’s not a marketing strategy.
It’s not another app promising to “empower” you while locking down your data and selling you out.</p>
<p>It’s <strong>freedom rooted in architecture.</strong>
Decentralization not just as a buzzword —
but as an expression of conviction.</p>
<p>A kind of freedom you can <em>feel</em> in your body:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When you zap someone’s words because they <em>moved you</em> — not because an algorithm told you to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When your identity is yours — keys, not credentials.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When no one can delete your story because <strong>you</strong> control the server, or because there <em>is</em> no server — just the relay of your choosing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This isn’t utopia.
There are egos. There’s noise. There’s still posturing.
But it’s different.
The <strong>center of gravity</strong> has shifted.</p>
<p>We’re no longer begging institutions to notice us.
We’re building <strong>outside their jurisdiction.</strong></p>
<p>And for the first time in a long time,
<strong>freedom feels close.
Tangible.
Joyful.
Alive.</strong></p>
<p>This isn’t just about tech.
It’s about trust.
It’s about choosing to show up —
to build
to write
to signal
to keep going.</p>
<p>Even when it’s hard.
Even when no one claps.</p>
<p>Because real freedom doesn’t come from being noticed.
It comes from being <strong>sovereign.</strong></p>
<p>And that’s something no one can take from me again.</p>
