        <p><strong>This is a reflection for seekers, skeptics, and sovereign thinkers on Nostr.In a world flooded with lies, it’s tempting to believe that everything is a lie. But real sovereignty isn’t just rejecting the mainstream — it’s learning to discern, verify, and walk in truth.This piece is a call to Bitcoiners, Christians, and freedom-seekers to resist the drift toward conspiratorial thinking that masquerades as enlightenment. It affirms that questioning is good — but truth is better.From faith to science, climate to population, war to liberty — this is a principled stand against false binaries and a plea for humble, truth-rooted conviction in an age of loud confusion.</strong></p>

        <p>Andrew G. Stanton - June 19, 2025</p>
<h1><strong>Don’t Trade One False Narrative for Another</strong></h1>
<p><em>A reflection for seekers, skeptics, and sovereign thinkers on Nostr</em></p>
<hr />
<h3>🔓 1. The Courage to Question Is Good</h3>
<p>Most of us came to Bitcoin — and maybe even to faith — because we questioned the stories we were told:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>That inflation is normal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That government debt doesn’t matter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That the mainstream always tells the truth</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That war is peace, and coercion is safety</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So we left. We exited the matrix.
That was good. That took courage.</p>
<hr />
<h3>🌪️ 2. But Questioning Can Become a Reflex</h3>
<p>Once you see one lie, it’s tempting to believe everything is a lie:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>NASA is fake</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Earth is flat</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jews run everything</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing is real</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trust no one</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But here’s the problem: <strong>you can become just as enslaved</strong> to <em>conspiracies</em> as you were to <em>institutions</em>.
You’ve left one cage, only to build another.</p>
<hr />
<h3>🧭 3. Sovereignty Requires Discernment</h3>
<p>Real sovereignty — the kind that Bitcoin models — is costly.
You have to verify. Not just doubt.</p>
<p>It’s not enough to say “the mainstream is lying.”
You have to <em>seek what’s true</em>, not just what’s hidden.
You have to <em>build</em>, not just deconstruct.</p>
<hr />
<h3>⚖️ 4. Freedom Is Not License</h3>
<p>There’s an element of <strong>anarchy</strong> in Bitcoin — and that’s not always a bad thing.
Freedom does require rejecting illegitimate authority.
But <strong>freedom is not license</strong>.</p>
<p>Sometimes the most <strong>rebellious</strong>, most <strong>countercultural</strong> thing you can do
is not scream louder…
but <strong>repent from your sins</strong>,
<strong>follow Jesus</strong>,
and <strong>submit your will to what the Spirit says</strong>.</p>
<p>That kind of surrender is more radical than any conspiracy theory.</p>
<hr />
<h3>📖 5. Where I Stand — Without Apology</h3>
<p>Since I know this post will be misunderstood by some, let me be clear:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>✅ I’m a <strong>Christian Zionist</strong>. I support Israel’s right to exist and defend itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>✅ The Earth is <strong>round</strong>. It <strong>revolves around the sun</strong>. That’s not a psyop — it’s observable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>✅ The universe began with a <strong>Big Bang</strong> over <strong>13 billion years ago</strong>. That doesn’t conflict with faith — it deepens it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>✅ I am <strong>anti-vax mandate</strong>, but I am <strong>not QAnon</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>✅ I am <strong>not a white nationalist</strong>, though I believe much of DEI and “wokeness” has gone too far.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>✅ I am <strong>strongly libertarian</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>✅ I am <strong>anti-war</strong> in principle, and I believe the U.S. should <strong>stop acting as the world’s policeman</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>✅ I <strong>do not hate anyone</strong> — including those I disagree with.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>✅ I <strong>think climate change is real</strong> — and always has been. Our planet has gone through many cycles of warming and cooling. I believe much of the hype around global warming being <em>purely</em> human-caused is up for honest debate.
    That said: <strong>just because I’m not a climate alarmist doesn’t mean I don’t care about the environment.</strong> Stewardship matters. We are called to cultivate, not consume blindly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>✅ I <strong>do not believe the Earth is overpopulated</strong>. In fact, many places now face <strong>net negative population growth</strong>. We are always just <strong>one generation away from extinction</strong>. This is not a call for panic — it’s a call to love life, build families, and steward creation wisely.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I also want to say clearly:</p>
<p>&gt; I <strong>deeply respect</strong> many voices in the Bitcoin space — like <strong>Saifedean Ammous</strong> and others — who would probably <strong>strongly disagree with me</strong> on some of these positions.
&gt; That’s okay. We can admire and learn from people even when we disagree, even <strong>very strongly</strong>, on certain issues.</p>
<p>That’s what mature sovereignty looks like.</p>
<hr />
<h3>🕊️ 6. Faith, Bitcoin, and the Narrow Road</h3>
<p>Jesus said “the truth will set you free,”
but He also said: <em>few find it.</em></p>
<p>Truth isn’t whatever gets you banned.
It’s not whatever shocks people.
It’s not whatever makes you feel smarter than the crowd.</p>
<p>Truth has a pattern. It’s humble. It’s costly. It bears fruit.</p>
<hr />
<h3>🛠️ 7. I’m Still Unlearning, Too</h3>
<p>I’ve believed lies. I’ve fallen for hype.
But I keep returning to the question:</p>
<p>&gt; “Is this true, or just countercultural?”
&gt; “Is this wisdom, or just rebellion in disguise?”</p>
<p>Bitcoin taught me to ask.
Faith taught me to listen.
The Spirit taught me to test.</p>
<hr />
<h3>💬 Final Thought</h3>
<p>You don’t need to accept the mainstream story.
But you also don’t need to accept every alternative one.</p>
<p>You’re allowed to walk slowly.
To ask real questions.
To love the truth more than the thrill.</p>
<p>Let’s be sovereign thinkers — not just louder ones.</p>
<hr />
