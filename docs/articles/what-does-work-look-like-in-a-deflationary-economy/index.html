        <p><strong>This post explores how work transforms in a deflationary economy inspired by Bitcoin. Instead of chasing endless hustle, workers are freed to choose meaningful, purpose-driven labor that endures. It contrasts today’s inflationary “race to keep up” with a slower, more deliberate future—one that values savings, truth, and craft over speed and monetization. Includes a personal invitation to connect with others walking this path.</strong></p>

        <p>Andrew G. Stanton - June 9, 2025</p>
<p>In an inflationary system, the goal is often just to <strong>keep up</strong>.</p>
<p>With prices always rising, most of us are stuck in a race:
Earn more to afford more.
Spend before your money loses value.
Monetize everything just to stay ahead of the curve.</p>
<p>Work becomes reactive.
You hustle to outrun rising costs.
You take on projects you don’t believe in just to make next month’s bills.
Money decays. So you move faster, invest riskier, and burn out quicker.</p>
<p>But what happens when the curve flips?</p>
<p>A <strong>deflationary economy</strong>—like the one Bitcoin makes possible—<strong>rewards stillness, reflection, and intentionality</strong>.</p>
<p>Time favors the saver, not the spender.
Money gains purchasing power.
You’re no longer punished for patience.</p>
<p>You don’t have to convert your energy into cash before it loses value.
You don’t have to be <em>always on</em>.
You can actually afford to wait for the right work.</p>
<p>And when you do work—it means more.</p>
<p>💡 The “bullshit jobs” David Graeber wrote about start to disappear.
There’s no need to look busy just to justify your existence.
There’s no reward for parasitic middle layers.
Instead, value flows to real <strong>craft</strong>, real <strong>care</strong>, and real <strong>proof of work</strong>—philosophically and literally.</p>
<p>So what does a job look like in that world?</p>
<p>— A farmer building soil instead of chasing subsidies.
— An engineer optimizing for simplicity instead of speed.
— A craftsman making one perfect table instead of ten cheap ones.
— A writer telling the truth without clickbait.
— A builder who says no more than they say yes.</p>
<p>You choose work that <strong>endures</strong>—not because it pays instantly, but because it’s worth doing.</p>
<p>The deflationary future isn’t a fantasy.
It’s a <strong>recalibration</strong>.</p>
<p>It’s not about working less.
It’s about working <strong>better</strong>.</p>
<p>That’s what Bitcoin taught me.
That’s what I’m trying to live now.</p>
