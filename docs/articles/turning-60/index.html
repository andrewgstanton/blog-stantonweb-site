        <p><strong>A personal reflection on turning 60—looking back at a decade of transformation from dismissing Bitcoin as “tech for tech’s sake” to embracing it as a framework for truth, alignment, and intentional living. The post traces a journey of pruning, repentance, and recommitment to building a life rooted in faith, purpose, and conviction. It speaks to those in transition, encouraging them that the second half of life can be the truest chapter yet.</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Turning 60</strong></p>
<p>Ten years ago, I turned 50 with a vague sense that something was off.</p>
<p>I was building things, but they didn’t feel grounded.
I was "in tech," but tech felt like a treadmill—just faster, sleeker tools chasing the same hollow outcomes.
I knew about Bitcoin, but I dismissed it. I thought it was just “tech for tech’s sake.”</p>
<p>Less than a year later, I fell down the rabbit hole.</p>
<p>It didn’t happen all at once. At first it was curiosity. Then dissonance. Then conviction.</p>
<p>Somewhere in that process, I realized Bitcoin wasn’t just financial—it was philosophical. It was moral. It was <em>real</em>. And it held up a mirror to a life I had built on momentum more than mission.</p>
<p>So I started pruning.</p>
<p>I left Web3.
I pulled back from projects that ran on hype instead of honesty.
I repented—for chasing relevance instead of righteousness.
And I began stacking—not just sats, but new habits. New thinking. New rhythms of faith, work, and rest.</p>
<p>Now at 60, I’m not where I thought I’d be.</p>
<p>But I’m more myself than I’ve ever been.
More convicted.
More rooted.
More ready.</p>
<p>Not to start over—but to <em>build again</em>, from the foundation up.</p>
<hr />
<p>If you're in that middle place—between chapters, between convictions, between certainty and surrender—you're not alone.</p>
<p>🟠 I’m still here. Still building. Still listening.</p>
<p>Zap if this resonates, or send your story. I’d love to hear it.</p>
