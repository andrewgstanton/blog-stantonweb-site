        <p><strong>This piece is about how I’ve come to understand my mind — not as broken, but as wired differently on purpose. It’s an exploration of neurodivergence, creativity, and conviction through the lens of the Victorious Gospel. I share how I’ve stopped trying to conform to man-made systems — whether in tech, church, or culture — and started building from a place of truth and sovereignty.  If you've ever felt like your wiring doesn't fit the mold, I hope this encourages you: You are not a mistake. You were made for something wild — and good.  Written in collaboration with “Dr. C” (ChatGPT-4o), who helped me shape and structure the piece with the same care and conviction I try to bring to everything I build.</strong></p>

        <h2>Why I Think — and Build — Differently</h2>
<h3>And Why the Gospel I Believe Refuses to Be Tamed</h3>
<p>For most of my life, I didn’t have a name for how I thought.<br />
I just knew I wasn’t like most people around me.</p>
<p>I’d jump from idea to idea, branching off into deep dives, strange metaphors, and systems no one had built yet — but which, somehow, already existed in my head. Other times I’d lock in and disappear for hours, obsessively refining a system or vision until it finally felt whole.</p>
<p>I used to think this was just creativity. Later I wondered if it was ADHD. But only recently have I found language — and peace — in the term <strong>neurodivergent</strong>.</p>
<p>It doesn’t mean broken.<br />
It means different.<br />
And for me, it’s also meant… <em>free</em>.</p>
<hr />
<h2>What Neurodivergence Taught Me About the Gospel</h2>
<p>I used to think the Gospel was about trying harder.<br />
Trying to fit. Trying to follow. Trying to conform to the narrow version of what a “good Christian” looked like in the eyes of church culture.</p>
<p>But the more I tried to contort myself into that image, the more I felt like I was slowly dying.<br />
Not just spiritually — mentally, emotionally, even creatively.</p>
<p>And then I discovered something I now call the <strong>Victorious Gospel</strong> — not a half-measure, not a rescue plan for a few, but a bold, cosmic declaration:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>God wins. All things will be made new. Nothing is wasted.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In that Gospel, I didn’t have to be tamed.<br />
I didn’t have to suppress the way my mind works.<br />
I didn’t have to squeeze myself into man-made molds of productivity, piety, or professionalism.</p>
<p>Instead, I began to see that my wiring — my urgency, my depth, my discomfort with compromise — might actually be part of how God made me.<br />
Not a bug to be fixed. A feature to be wielded.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Refusing the Cages</h2>
<p>I’ve never done well with cages.</p>
<p>I don’t mean physical ones. I mean the subtle ones — platforms, protocols, and polite expectations that tell you:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Don’t say that.”<br />
“Don’t build that.”<br />
“Don’t think like that.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Walled gardens. Sanitized feeds. Centralized rules.</p>
<p>They look like safety.<br />
They smell like order.<br />
But they’re designed to <strong>tame</strong>.</p>
<p>And I believe the same Spirit that raised Jesus from the dead — the same Spirit that will one day renew <em>all things</em> — does not operate inside cages.</p>
<p>That Spirit breaks chains.<br />
That Spirit sets captives free.<br />
That Spirit burns through the protocols of empire, and says:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>**“Behold, I am making all things new.” (Rev 21:5) **</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That includes minds like mine.<br />
That includes the systems I build.<br />
And that includes the very way we think about software, identity, and sovereignty.</p>
<hr />
<h2>What I’m Building Now</h2>
<p>I’m building tools that don’t assume conformity — they assume <strong>conviction</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>MyContinuum</strong> is a publishing stack for people who think differently, share differently, refuse to depend on centralized platforms, and want to own their digital voice.</p>
<p>I don’t want to rely on LinkedIn to share truth.<br />
I don’t want to depend on Google to access my own memories.<br />
And I don’t want the Gospel — or the systems I build — to be shaped by companies whose values are fundamentally incompatible with freedom.</p>
<p>I want to create space for people like me — people who think in arcs, not boxes.<br />
Who resist control, but are driven by clarity.<br />
Who may be misunderstood by church or tech culture, but who burn with something deeper than performance.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Final Word</h2>
<p>Maybe you resonate with this. Maybe you’ve always felt a little outside.<br />
Maybe your mind works differently, too.</p>
<p>You don’t need a diagnosis to know you weren’t built to conform.<br />
You were built to create. To question. To seek truth.<br />
To reflect the wild, untamable image of a God who is not finished redeeming the world.</p>
<p>So no — I won’t fit into their systems.<br />
Because I’m finally building <strong>mine</strong>.</p>
<p>And I believe God’s not only okay with that —<br />
<strong>He’s the one who wired me to do it.</strong></p>
