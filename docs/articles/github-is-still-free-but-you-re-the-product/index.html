        <h1>GitHub Is Still Free — But You're the Product</h1>

        <p><strong>GitHub remains free and widely used, but its acquisition by Microsoft has shifted its role from open-source steward to data-harvesting platform. As GitHub integrates more tightly with tools like Copilot and Azure, developers face growing risks of lock-in, surveillance, and platform dependency. This article explores the tradeoffs of “free” tools, the importance of digital sovereignty, and emerging alternatives like Cloudflare Pages, Nostr, and self-hosted Git platforms. It’s not just about cost—it’s about control.</strong></p>

        <p>For years, GitHub has been the default home for open source developers. It built its reputation on transparency, collaboration, and a commitment to giving coders a place to share and improve their work. But since Microsoft's acquisition in 2018, subtle changes have begun to surface—not all of them in service to the user.</p>
<p>GitHub is still free. Public repositories remain free. Even private repositories are free, to a point. GitHub Pages, Actions, and Codespaces offer incredibly powerful tools to build and deploy projects at no cost—until you hit certain usage limits or need team-scale features.</p>
<p>But the deeper question is this: <strong>what do you give up in exchange?</strong></p>
<h3>Microsoft Doesn’t Give Away Infrastructure for Free</h3>
<p>GitHub, VSCode, Copilot, and Azure form a tightly integrated ecosystem. On the surface, it's all about productivity. But underneath, it's about data. Your code trains their models. Your habits inform their products. Your workflows deepen their lock-in.</p>
<p>Take Copilot, for example: it’s not just a coding assistant, it’s a data-harvesting engine built on top of a centralized platform. The more you use GitHub, the more Microsoft knows about what developers are building—and what they might buy.</p>
<h3>Free Isn’t Sovereign</h3>
<p>As developers, we have to ask hard questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What happens when the free tier disappears or changes?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can I take my work elsewhere without breaking my stack?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who owns the insights derived from my development patterns?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These questions aren’t hypothetical. We’ve seen them play out with Heroku, Medium, Twitter, and countless others. Free turns into friction. Then friction becomes control.</p>
<h3>Alternatives Are Emerging</h3>
<p>Thankfully, there are options:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Codeberg</strong>, <strong>Gitea</strong>, and <strong>SourceHut</strong> for Git hosting</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cloudflare Pages</strong> for static sites + edge functions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Railway</strong>, <strong>Fly.io</strong>, or even VPS hosting for dynamic apps</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Nostr</strong> and <strong>IPFS</strong> for decentralized publishing</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These aren’t always drop-in replacements. But they represent a healthier direction—one aligned with freedom, transparency, and a proof-of-work ethos rather than a proof-of-data-capture business model.</p>
<h3>My Move Away from GitHub (Sort Of)</h3>
<p>I’m not deleting my GitHub account. It’s still the best way to reach other devs. But for key projects—especially those that touch on identity, sovereignty, or censorship resistance—I’m migrating:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Private infrastructure where needed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cloudflare for front-end deployments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nostr for publishing and archiving</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Git mirroring to open alternatives</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Because the tools we use shape the future we build. And if the platform is free, but the product is you—it's time to re-evaluate.</p>
